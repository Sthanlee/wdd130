        <p>Hello! Stanley is a fashion designer from Nigeria who fell in love with sewing early.
            What started as a
            hobby became a way for me to express myself and build something real. I learned
            through trial and
            error, long nights, and a lot of patience. Today, my designs reflect where I'm
            from. Practical,
            bold, and made with care. For Stanley, every stitch tells part of my story and my
            journey.</p>
